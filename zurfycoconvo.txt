üöÄ Ready to Start?
Which component should we tackle first?

Database Schema Design - Foundation for everything
Design Analysis API - Core differentiator
Team Hiring Strategy - Get the right people
AWS Infrastructure Setup - Technical foundation

Or do you want to dive into the specific code for any component? I can create the actual implementation files, database schemas, API endpoints, or ML model architecture.
The clock is ticking - every day we don't build this is a day competitors could catch up! Let's get started! üí•RetryRPi dont have a budget or investment funds to use - its just me doing this project. there is not going to be a team or getting the right people segment, its only me alone.  But i can do this. and this is exclusively for automating the workflows of Etsy, Shopify, Canva, and Printify.  So lets start with the coding for all components.  Lets tackle each one by one in order .EditCrafted solo-developer strategy for e-commerce workflow automation.Ah, this is a crucial clarification! The user is a solo developer with no budget/investment funds, and it's just them working on this project. This completely changes the approach - I need to:

Remove all the team/hiring/budget aspects
Focus on solo-developer friendly architecture
Use free/low-cost solutions
Make it specifically for Etsy, Shopify, Canva, Printify automation
Start with actual code implementation
Break it down into manageable solo-developer chunks

Let me create a practical, solo-developer implementation plan with actual code for each component, starting with the foundation.üî• PERFECT! SOLO DEVELOPER MODE ACTIVATED!
You're absolutely right - let's build this empire with just your skills and determination! I'll create a practical, zero-budget implementation with actual code for each component.
